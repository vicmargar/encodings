Character Sets and Character Encodings.

ASCII: http://http://ascii-table.com/ 7 bits (127 characters)

Different uses for that remaining bit (code pages):

This kind of worked for a while, as long as documents where used on the same machine
as they were created, and you only had to deal with one language.

As soon as the Internet happened it became quite common to move strings from one 
machine to another.

Unicode:

It's an effort to create a character set that includes every writing system in the
planet, including dead and ficticious languages.

A letter is mapped to a number (code point) and this is just a concept, it has nothing
to do with its physical representation.

Some of the problems in defining this standard have to do with identifying which 
letters in different languages are actually the same.

Hello
U+0048 U+0065 U+006C U+006C U+006F

Encodings:

One obvious way of encoding those code points would be using 2 bytes per code point:
00 48 00 65 00 6C 00 6C 00 6F

But this could also be:
48 00 65 00 6C 00 6C 00 6F 00

This is actually UTF-16/UCS2 and it has both little endian and big endian mode.
There is a convention to store a Byte Order Mask (BOM) at the beginning of the file:
FE FF or FF FE but it's not always there

Encoding English in this way wastes a lot of space since most characters are below +U00FF

Unicode Transformation Format-8 (UTF-8):
UTF-8 encodes each Unicode character as a variable number of 1 to 4 octets, where the number of octets depends on 
the integer value assigned to the Unicode character. It is an efficient encoding of Unicode documents that use 
mostly US-ASCII characters because it represents each character in the range U+0000 through U+007F as a single octet.
UTF-8 is the default encoding for XML.

Hello - 48 65 6C 6C 6F

There is also UCS4/UTF32 - Really inefficient.

UTF-8 is more efficient for western languages but for other languages UTF-16 can be more efficient.

Open hello.latin1 and hello.utf8 in TextViewer
Open hello.latin1 and hello.utf8 in Chrome, change encoding of both files.

xxd hola.latin1
xxd hola.utf8

See how ASCII characters are encoded the same in utf8 and latin1.
See how UTF8 encoding takes more space for some characters.

Text without knowing it's encoding doesn't mean anything, it's just bytes.
How to specify encoding:
HTTP   - Content Type Header.
HTML   - Content Type meta tag. This could be tricky but it isn't. The meta tag should be the first thing in the 
head section. Browsers try to guess based on frequency of bytes.
E-mail - Content Type Header
