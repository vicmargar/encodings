ASCII: http://http://ascii-table.com/ 7 bits (127 characters)

Different uses for that remaining bit (code pages):

This kind of worked for a while, as long as documents where used on the same machine
as they were created, and you only had to deal with one language.

As soon as the Internet happened it became quite common to move strings from one 
machine to another.

Unicode:

It's an effort to create a character set that includes every writing system in the
planet, including dead and ficticious languages.

A letter is mapped to a number (code point) and this is just a concept, it has nothing
to do with its physical representation.

Some of the problems in defining this standard have to do with identifying which 
letters in different languages are actually the same.

Hello
U+0048 U+0065 U+006C U+006C U+006F

Encodings:

Open hola.latin1 and hola.utf8 in TextViewer
Open hola.latin1 and hola.utf8 in Chrome, change encoding of both files.

xxd hola.latin1
xxd hola.utf8

See how ASCII characters are encoded the same in utf8 and latin1.
See how UTF8 encoding takes more space for some characters.

Text without knowing it's encoding doesn't mean anything, it's just bytes.
How to specify encoding:
